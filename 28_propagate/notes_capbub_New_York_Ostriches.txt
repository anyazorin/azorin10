V1:
- Prediction that it will alert text inside table element when clicked
- Observation matched up with prediction

V2:
- Prediction that it will alert the individual cell, the row that its in, as well as the entire table when a cell is clicked on
-Observation matches up with prediction though it also alerts the html tags within the row and table as well
// Q: When user clicks on a cell, in what order will the pop-ups appear?
The order the pop ups will occur is from deepest element outward regardless of order of appearance in code.

V3: 
// Q: When user clicks on a cell, in what order will the pop-ups appear?
- Prediction that it will act the same as before without uncommenting anything
- Observation that alerts came in order of table to cell to row, possibly due to the true parameter at the end of the third addEventListener
//Q: What will happen when next line is uncommented?
- Prediction that it will only alert the table in html
- Observation matches up with prediction
//Q: What effect does the boolean arg have? 
-Prediction that it will act the same as before
-Observation that setting the boolean to true makes the table html alert first, and setting it as false makes it alert last

V4:
- Prediction that it will act the same as V2 without uncommenting anything
- Observed that it will alert in the opposite order (table -> row -> cell) due to the true paramter in all the addEventListeners
//Q: What will happen when next line is uncommented?
- Prediction that it will only alert whats in the cell when cell clicked on
- Observation that it will only alert the table in HTML before stopping when a cell is clicked on
//Q: Does the order in which the event listeners are attached matter?
- Prediction: No
- Observations matched up as predicted
//Q: What effect does the boolean arg have in each?
-the true boolean makes the element alert first with priority to the outermost element (table-->row-->cell), and the flase boolean will make an element alert last, once again giving most priority to table, then row, then cell.
